# Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Introduction

Strap in everyone, I'm about to do this all in a 6h semi-concious state with 0 regards to programming guidelines, self care or my mentality. If you find an issue, please, clone the repo to fix it. Thanks and enjoy o7.

Now to be serious.

This repository contains the code and resources for training and deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for brain detection. The CNN model is designed to classify brain images into different categories, such as normal brain images and images with abnormalities or diseases.

## Requirements

Before using this code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- An environment with GPU support is recommended for faster training (optional)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Dataset

To train and evaluate the brain detection model, you will need a dataset of brain images. You should organize your dataset into two main folders:

1. **Training Data**: This folder should contain subfolders for each class you want to classify (e.g., "giloma tumor, meingioma tumor, no tumor and pituitary tumor" used in this data). Each subfolder should contain the corresponding images.

2. **Testing Data**: Similarly, this folder should contain subfolders with test images for each class.

Ensure that the dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the images are appropriately labeled.

## Usage

To use this code for brain detection, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajaybirrandhawa/braindetectioncnn.git
cd braindetectioncnn
```

2. Organize your dataset as described in the "Dataset" section.

3. Update the configuration file (if needed) to adjust hyperparameters, such as batch size, learning rate, and the number of training epochs.

4. Train the CNN model by replacing the training file with yours.

5. After training, you can evaluate the model on the test dataset (replace it as you wish).

6. You can deploy the trained model for inference in your application (see "Deployment" section below).

## Training

The training section of the code loads the dataset, constructs the CNN model, and trains it using the specified hyperparameters. Make sure to customize the model architecture and training parameters according to your specific dataset and requirements.

## Evaluation

The evaluation section of the script allows you to assess the model's performance on a separate test dataset. It calculates metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

## Deployment

To deploy the trained brain detection model in your application, you can use the saved model from the training process. You can load the model using TensorFlow's `tf.keras.models.load_model` and use it for inference on new brain images.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the saved model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('/path/to/saved_model')

# Perform inference on new images
predictions = model.predict(new_test_values)
```

Make sure to preprocess new images in the same way as the training data before making predictions.
